# Personal website

Here is the code I used to build my personal website. It's 100% free because
it's deployed on Heroku so you can use it as template to build yours too. If
you want more informations, you can contact me by
mail (**seyive.kiki@gmail.com**).

Here is the [link](https://yannick-kiki.herokuapp.com) of the website. 

And for the purists who will notice that I have not written the tests yet,
do not worry, it's planned for the next release.
